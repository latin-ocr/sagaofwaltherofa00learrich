194 WAL THER OF AQUJTAJNE.

with the description in W (490 ff). The defile seems to have come to
be regarded later as extending over the whole mons Vosegus as a
district. Hence Wasgenstein as Walther's land in Ths is only natural
and consistent with the later confusion, of which Ths affords many
examples. With the Wasgenstein as Walther's land is connected,
doubtless, the name os W's sword ⁴ Wasge ’; the account of his being
set over Gerimsheim (Gernsheim in Hassen ?) by Ermanric (Ths c.
151); of his presence (as guest ?) in Breisach (AT, 307); of his German
origin (AT, 426); and of his relation as vassal os Theoderic (AT, 11).
This last conception ofVValther is t04be traced probably to Upper
Germany, particularly to Alemannia, where Theoderic was regarded
as the protector of the Upper Germans against the Franks.

ι Waltlzer czs Ermanric's Nepkew.-The conception of VValther as
the son of Ermanric's sister in Ths, and that of Hildegunde as the
daughter of Iarl Ilias of Greece is due to the later confusion os Saga
elements by the combination of different cycles into a great composite
narrative such as we have in the Thidrekssaga.¹58 VValther carne
to be regarded as Ermanric’s kinsman, doubtless aster the latter
appeared in the Saga as Theoderic's foe, that is, from the tenth
century on.159 The view that Walther was connected with the
Lombard cycle is consistent with this, inasmuch as Lombard heroes
were regarded as being at Ermanric‘s Court.¹⁶⁰ Indeed, the Lombard
conquest of Italy, united in the popular mind with the East
Roman overthrow os the East Goths by justinian, is doubtless
reflected in the conception of Ermanric as Roman Emperor and
Theoderic's foe.

Wzltlzer as α Palen—The general characteristics os the VValther
Saga which have passed over into the Polish versions, have preserved
reminiscences of VValther's origin from Kerlingen, and os his com-
panion, the sair Hildegunde‚ at the court of a Frankish (—-Burgundian)
king, and ofthe hero⁷s great prowess in combat.

bl'altlzer the Ham—In the ‘Chanson de Roland' (cs. App. ii.)
mention is made of ‘Gualtiers de l’Hum,’* as one of the faithful
defenders of the cause ofCharlemagne. Heinzel makes use of this as
an argument for the conception of VValther as of Hunish origin. But
it is rather to be interpreted as meaning ⁸ VValtber from or of the Hun
(or Huns),’ and thus designating the most characteristic factos his
career; namely, his exile among the Huns. That this VValther
from the Huns should fight, as king of Aquitania, upon the side of
Charlemagne against the Infidels, is perfectly intellegible. Compare
Hadubraht's scornful words to Hildebrant, ‘alter Hun' (‘Hilde-
brantslied,' v. 38). So, in ¹ Rolandslied‚’ ‘lValthere the Wigant,’ who
