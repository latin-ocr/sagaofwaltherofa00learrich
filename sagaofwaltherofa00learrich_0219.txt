lVAL'l'HER OF AQL'H‘AlNE. ¹9¹
Let us trace, then, the conception of Aquitania during this· ezirlx
period.

Aquitania ¹53 of Caesar‘s time, Aquitania Propria, or Novempopu-
lana (of Diocletian's provincial division), occupied the countrv
between the Atlantic, the Garonne. and the Pyrenees, and extendet!
eastward nearly to Tolosa. Aquitania north of the Carmine. in
Diocletian's time, extended northward and eastward nearly to the
Liger, and southward almost to the Tarnis, and was divided hv
Diocletian into two provinces: Aquitania l. in the east, und
Aquitania ΙΙ, in the west. The West Goths, having pushed their way
from Rome to Aquitania Propria (Burdigala). about 4¹3- occupied.
from 419 to 475, the three Aquitanias mentioned above, extending
their domain eastward to the borders of Burgundia. Thus Aquitania
and Burgundia were border provinces or kingdoms at the time of
Attila’s campaign to the west (451), and Aquitania Propria of

· earlier times was now Novempopulana; while Vasconia lay between

Novempopulana and the Iberus, with Pampilona as its chief city. ln
507 lVest Gothic Aquitania (l and ΙΙ) came by the defeat of Alaric ll.
into the hands of the Franks under Chlodovech. At the death of
Theoderic (526) Burgundia was fast coming under Frankish control,
and after 534 was a part of the Frankish realm. At the death of
Justinian (565), Burgundia formed the western border of the Lombard
kingdom in Italy, and extended to the Mediterranean. Thus, we see
that the general historica} conception of Aquitania from the second
quarter of the fifth century through the Merovingian and Carlovingian
periods, was that of a province (country, hence, kingdom} lying
immediately west of Burgundia. Such, too, is the conception in
U'altharitis, the earliest complete, and historically most faithful,
full extant version of the saga.

¹ The popular tradition of Walther, as transmitted by the epics, is,
that he was of Germanic origin, and there seems to be no reason for
questioning this belief. If he was of Germanic descent, and an
Aquitanian, to what Germanic nationality did he belong? As an
Aquitanian, he would have belonged, politically, to the XVest Goths
before 507, and after that date to the Franks, if he was from Aquitania
north of the Gamnne, but, if he was from Aquitania Propria, to the
XVest Goths until Chlothar 11, who united this province to the Frankish
realm. This does not mean that &Valther must have been of ll'est
Gothic origin; indeed, he may just as likely have been a representa-
tive of some other Germanic race which passed into, or through,
Aquitania at this period. This much may be claimed. however:
tluzt Walther, in tlze oldest form of the saga, was α Germanic—
Aquz'tanian under lVest Gothic supremacy. The conception of
Aquitania as a kingdom, does not, even in this early period. interfere
with this point os view, inasmuch as the idea of kingship was one os
