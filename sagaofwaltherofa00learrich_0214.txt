186 WALTHER OF AUQJTAJNE.

Paprockiy but not in the Chronicle; such, sor example, as the name
Arinaldus for Walther’s rival; and Rynga for lVislaw's sister; and
l‘Vislimier for lNislaw3 and other matters of detail.¹3⁰

Bielski, in the first part os his account, may have made use of either
Paprocki or the Chronicle3 but in the second part he agrees with the
Chronicle rather than with Paprocki, particularly in mentioning
XVislaw as Prince of VVislica, and in the details of the encounter with
XVislaw. Another item of Bielski’s account, that VValther and Hilde-
gunde take treasure with them, would seem to indicate a third source

connecting Bielski's account more directly with the Waltharius
version. The further touches peculiar to Bielski ; as, the unwillingness

of the Frankish King to allow lValther to have Hildegunde because
he was a foreigner, could find a ready explanation in the animosity
existing between Poles and Germans. Niesiecki, W6jcicki. and the
later Polish chroniclers, drew their materials doubtless, from the Great
Polish Chronicle. Paprocki. and Bielski.

A comparison of the Polish with the German versions shows:

1. That the general outlines of the Saga are preserved in the Polish,
though the episodes and ethnical grouping are materially changed ;

2. That the Polish version is a fusion oftwo evidently heterogeneous
parts, a foreign, ancl a native; the first containing episodes of the
lValther Saga; the second, a union of this Saga with that of VVislaw,
or (as Paprocki, and presumably, Andreas of Zarnow, have it) of
lVislimier3

3. That &Valther combats against one foe, not many (twelve), as in
w, Ths.

Q That the Polish form of the Saga connot have been derived from ἦ
Ὲὶζκεὴεπόέ XValtharius, is evident from the fact that most of the
characteristic details of the St. Gall version are wanting in the
Polish.131 How, then, did the original, or originals, of the Polish
versions come to Tyniec? Passing over Rischka's argument for the
existence of the Saga in Poland before the Folkwandering as untena-
ble (see below), we find no evidence that the Saga migrated to Poland
before the second half of the tenth century (962) when Poland, under
Prince Misaca, or Mscislaw‚ became tributary to the German Emperor,
Otto Ι. Mscislaw married Dubrawka‚ the Christian daughter of
Boleslaw13 and in 966 accepted Christianity, thus bringing Poland
under Christian influence. Otto Ι. encouraged all efforts to missionize
among the Poles. Thus the German sagas may have found their way
to Poland in the time ostcislaw, “the first historical Piast, the actual
founder of Poland.''¹32

As to the founding of the Monastary at Tyniec there are two views;
Dlugosz states that it was founded in 1044 by Kazimierz, who,
according to tradition had been a monk at Clugny before he carne to
