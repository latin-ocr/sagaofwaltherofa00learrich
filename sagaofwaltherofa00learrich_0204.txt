1. ORIGINAL FORM OF THE SAGA.

The first step in determining the original form of the Saga, is to
ascertain what elements, or episodes, are common to all the versions:
or, ifnone are constant throughout all the texts, to find what episodes
are most permanent. A glauce at the analysis of the texts will show
that certain incidents are uniform almost without exception, and
others with but few variationis. There are at least four episodes which
recur consistently in all of the complete and most of the fragmentary
versions of this Saga:

1. The sojourn at a foreign court. Walther and Hildegunde are
together at court outside of &Valther‘s land. (W, N C, Nl, probably
G F and V F, BD, Ths, BC, P, B, N, PC, Woj.)

2. The escape. &Valther flees with Hildegunde [and takes treasure
with him] (W, NC, Nl, VF, BD, Ths, BC, P, B, N. PC, Woj.) The
taking of treasure is a natural accompaniment of such escape and
doubtless belongs to this episode, though it is not equally emphasized
in all the versions.

3. Pursuit and combat. walthef fights with his pursuers in single
combat. (WF, W, NC, doubtless iu Nl, VF, BD, Ths, BC. P, B,
probably N and P. Woj.) ln BD the combat is between VValther and
Riidigere because of the abduction of Hildegude3 but this is doubt-
less a reminiscence of the same motive as that os the combat with
the Huns in the Ths and VF.

4. Triumphant return home. VValther, victorious over his pursuers,
continues hisjourney homeward with Hildegunde (W, wanting in Nc
doubtless by accident, VF, Ths, BC, P, B, implied in N and PC, Woj.)
The NC account seems to break off abruptly before reaching the
return os Walther and Hildegund.

There is also another episode or group of episodes, which many of
the versions contain in some form or other. This is the account of
iValther's exploits after his return. (W, NC, implied in VF, BD,
Ths, BC, Woj.)

The fact that these general outlines are so consistently preserved in
the great majority of the texts, and are contradicted by nothing in the
fragmentary accounts of the Saga, furnishes a strong presumption that
these episodes, the first four at least, belong to the original form from
which the extant versions developed. It is to be noted, however,
that while the general sketch of the Saga remains essentially the
same, the details of the separate incidents vary greatly in the ver.
