THE present edition of the Walther Saga is the first attempt

to offer in complete form all the surviving episodes of the
Saga. The point of view and method of treatment are his-
torical from first to last. The texts of the versions have been
arranged in chronological order so as to present the Saga in its
transmitted form. The aim of the treatment is to set forth the
historica] elements and setting of the Saga, and thus rescue it
from vague, mythical interpretations. If order is ever to be
brought out of chaos in the interpretation of Saga and Myth, it
must be done by keeping in view the historical background,
and by close adherence to the historica] method. Indeed, both
myth and saga express in some form actual eventa—the one in
the realm of natural phenomena, the other in that of historica]
occurrences.
. In reproducing such a great variety vof texts it has been
necessary: in some cases, to make typographical substitutions‚
particularly in the Polish texts. The author, therefore, begs the
indulgence of those whose eye may be offended by the liberty
taken with the customary Polish characters, which could not be
obtained at the time (cf. note on page 110). The few cases
in which possible confusion might arise are the following:
genitive fevzz'm'nerforms (including those used adverbiallylv
which readers of Polish will readily recognize.
