180 WAL THER OF AQUJTAJNE.

Hildegunde, there would seem to be but one probable alternative, as
Heinzel¹07 believes; namely, it is Hagen who speaks. If this be
assumed, the references to the virtue of Mimming, VVeland's work,
to walther’s valor in the sword-play, to &Valther as wine min, would
be quite in place; the words gisede to eoce unc (A 25) would refer
possibly to the sword given when &Valther and Hagen were knighted
by Etzel (BD, 770—71); the situation would represent the moment
when Hagen has utterly refused to fight with VValther and given him
the Sword Mimming, leaving him and Gunther to end the combat.
This explanation would preclude the necessity of reconciling the
references and courageous words in A with Hildegunde's timidity
which is so prominent in the XValtharius. This explanation would
make Hagen remain true to his old companion as the latter evidently
had expected him to do (w, 1239 ff.). The passage contains real
difficulties, but such as are of minor importance, and the general
agreement in situation between WF. and w. is placed beyond
question. In any case Stephens' order of the Fragments must be
retained.

The W’aldere Fragments contain, however, besides these variations
of motive mentioned above, some references not found in the
waltharius: Gunther is called “wine Burgenda '' (B. 14) not king of
the Franks, as in W. 3 and reference is made to Theoderic or Deodric
(B. 4), which shows a connection at this early period between the Saga
of &Valther and that of Theoderic3 while in W. no trace exists of
any such connection. This reference to'Gunther as friend or lord of
the Burgundians accords more closely with history and would seem
to indicate a clearer‚ and hence earlier, conception of Gunther: The
same point of view is found in Widsin, who represents Gifica as ruling
the Burgends. With this conception osGunther as a Burgundian, it is
not easy to locate Hildegunde. We are lest to conjecture, that she
may have represented some province of Gothic or Frankish Gaul.108

If we now turn to the lVastharius, we shall find that there is already
clear recognition of the Saga oflVeland in the reference to Wal-
tharius' coat of mail as “lVelandia fabrica ” (965), which is a parallel
to ‘¹ Welandes geworc '’ in W'aldere (A, 2). The question here is
twofold: was the original given to Ekkehard I. by his master
Geraldus‚109 a different version from that of the lValdere3 or, did
Ekkehard Ι. and his successors change their original by adapting it to
Frankish conditions of a later time (tenth century 1¹0)? The following
seems to be the most likely: The· original of Ekkehard Ι. was an
alliterative poem in German speech. The arguments for this are :—

1. Traces of such alliteration in the Latin lValtharius. Jacob
Grimmm suggested such traces by translating the Latin back into
German; as, for example, lValtharius vocor ex Aquitanas sum
generatus (597)-—- Walthari fona Wasc6m; Hagano spinosus--Hagano
