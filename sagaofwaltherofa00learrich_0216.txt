3. WALTi-{ER ΟΡ ΑΩυΙΤΑΙΝΕ.

Before attempting any interpretation of &Valthen it may be well to
review briefly previous attempts in this direction.

Alytlzz'cal interpretation os Waltlzen—-At the outset, let us clear
away the mists which have collected around the Saga by the work os
Rischka and Rydberg. Rischka’s240 argument that the Polish saga
of &Valther is the primitive form. developed frorn the German myth
found in the sagas odehur and of Hothar and Baldur—Waldgierz
being Odin, and Hildegunde, Freyja——rests upon the following
assumptions:

1. That the Heroic Saga is developed out of a myth or divinity
(“und so entsteht aus einer Gottergestalt eine Heldensage,’' S. 32-
Here he follows Simrock) ;

2. That coincidence os episodes is a sufficient criterion of identifi-
cation os mythical and heroic characters;

3. That the Folkwandering was the occasion os the migration os this
saga to the most widely separated regions 3

4. That the Polish form os the Saga was probably developed among
a part of some Germanic people remaining in the territory afterwards
occupied by the Slavs (Potes), and having united with Slavic elements,
was localized.

The sutility os Rischka’s attempt as regards both method and
matter, has been demonstrated by Bugge 14¹ and by Heinzel.¹⁴² This
might seem in itself sufficient refutation os Rischka's argument. But
this method of saga-treatment, which confuses heroic saga with
myth, and brings all saga material into an interminable jumble with
remote mythical cycleS, is so serious in its results, that it must be
summarily disposed os at the outset. The following considerations
may serve to show the weakness os Rischka’s treatment: unproved
assumptions, as we have seen above, form the basis os the argument.
Rischka magnifies unduly the pre-migratory German element sur-
viving on Polish soil, and ignores the more important subsequent
German influences from the end of the tenth century sorward. The
disparity between the first and second parts of the Polish saga, he
fails sufficiently to recognize. The most characteristic features of the
saga found in the German versions are wanting in the Polish. The
spirit and character of the Baldur and Necklace myths are too far

removed from the &Valther Saga. The supposable similarity between
