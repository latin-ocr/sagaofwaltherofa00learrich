Attila.—Os all the characters os Germanic Saga, none has lest a
deeper and more distinct impress upon tradition than Attila. (the son
Mundzuc‚ or Mundiuch), King of the Huns, Sconrge os Cod. 'l'he
career of this meteor os history is recorded with much detail by Pris-
cus‚¹3 Cassiodorus,¹⁴ jordanes 15 and others. Briefly summarized it
runs thus:

First period, Conquests in the East. After ilie death of theiruncle.
Rua, (433) the brothers Bleda and Attila succeeded to t‘ne rule of the
Huns. Having made a treaty with the Romans they set out to sul,-
due the Scythian peoples. Attila put his brother Bleda out os the
way (445) and thus became sole ruler of the Huns. Having found the
old '‘sword of Mars.'‘ which was sacred to the Scythians and had not
been seen for ages. he renewed his wars with fresh vigorand at length
forced Rome to an ignominious treaty.

Attila‘s second great movement. initiated by his contlicts with
the Romans, was the campaign against the Gcrmanic peoples of the
west. While his eyes were thus turned westward. encouragements
came from two directions: one from Geneseric ‘⁴ the searsul Yan·
dal,’' ¹6 the other from one of the Frankish princes, who sought
Attila’s aid against the united force of Aetius and the other Frankish
prince. Attila accordingly advanced westward with live hundred
thousand Ι7 men, seigning to the Romans (Valentiniani that he
intended to attack the XVest Goths, and to Theoderic, the West Goth,
that he wished to free Gaul from the Roman yoke. In the year 451
Attila’s army appeared in two main divisions ; one moving along the
right bank of the Danube via Augst to the Upper Rhine, the other
coming around the Odenwald toward Mainz. The southern division
probably passed via Strassburg to Metz‚ while the northern went via
Trier through Belgium toward Paris, though it seems not to have
reached this city.18 Attila was with the former division at Metz.
Having plundered and burned Scarpona and Rheims, he marched on
via Chalons. Troyes and Sens toward Orleans. Aetius meanwhile had
crossed the Alps, united with the forces os Gaul-
