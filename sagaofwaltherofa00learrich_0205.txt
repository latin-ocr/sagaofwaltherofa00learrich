that os Attila in the waltharius, Nox-alician Chronicle, Nibelungen-
lied, Vienna Fragment, Biterolfund Dietleib. 'l‘hidreksaga and. pro-
bably, in the Waldere and Graz Fragments, while in the l'olish ver-
sion it is the court of the king of the Franks. Again. the pursuit and
combat in the XValtharius take place at the hands of Gunther and his
men; while in Thidreksaga it is Attila's men who pursue and attack
W'althem and in the Polish version. the Prince of Alamannia. Thus.
in the German version ofthe Saga we have two combats mentioned:
one with the Huns, the other with the Franks* (Burgundians). The
question then arises whether one, or both, or neither, of these contests
belonged to the original form of the Saga. The accountof the combat
with the Huns occurs in the Vienna Fragment. Biterolf und Dietleib
and the Thidreksaga; while the contest with the Burgundians is men-
tioned in the XValdere, waltharius, Novalicien Chronicle. Nibelun-
genlied‚ ‘von dem iibelen wibe.‘ The fact that the notice of the
battle with the Burgundians is found in the U'aldere and waltharius,
shows that it had a place in the Saga as early as the ninth century.
Is, however, we allow time for the development of the essential differ-
ences between the &Valdere and the Waltharius and assume with
symons,96 that the XValdere is as early as the middle of the eighth
century, we may reasonablv date the separation of the Waldere and
XValtharius forms at the beginning of the eighth century, If this be
correct, it precludes the possibility of the very late development of
the story of this combat. It is not improbable that the original form
of the Saga from which the Low German and Alemannic versions
(XYaldere and XValtharius) developed, contained also the account of
the contest with the Huns. That there was a faint reminiscence of
such a struggle may possibly be inferred from the reference in &Val-
tharius 97 to the vengeful rage of Attila. and his promise of rich
reward for walther‘s capture. XVhether the combat with the Huns is
‘⁶ nur eine variation der ersten [der alemannischen gestalt] und gewis
frankisches ursprungs’' as Mullenhoff98 maintains‚ or is the more
original, as Heinzel99 thinks probable, is not yet clear. lt seems
more likely that both combat—episodes developed about the same time
and were afterwards separated in the growth of the Saga. This
much, however, seems certain from the almost constant occurrence
of the battle incident in the versions, that the story of the combat was
contained in the original form from which the extant texts have de·
veloped. Thus, the primitive setting of the narrative consisted not
simply of an account of the escape home without notice of either
contest (⁸ Flucht in die Heimat Ἴ, as Heinzel ¹00 supposes: but of the
sojourn at a foreign court (that of Attila); the escape with the maiden
(Hildegunde); the pursuit and combat (with the Burgundians and,
possibly, with the Huns), and the triumphant return. The story of
the exploits os XValther after his return may have been added later to
