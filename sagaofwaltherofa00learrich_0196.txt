168 WALTHER OF AQUJTAJNE.

4. Aigyna’s position as protector of the Aquitainian border might
explain Hagen's being witness at the betrothal of VValther and

Hildegeunde.34
5. Aigyna's conquest of the VVascons might have given rise to the

conception of Hagen as the father of Hilde, of Portegal ; 35

6. The cruel character of Aigyna would serve as the parallel sorthe
grim-visaged Hagen of the Nibelungenlied.

7. Aigyna was also a contemporary of the furious Brunhilde (whose
character is reflected in the Nibelungenlied ?).36

that‚ then, is the value of this parallel between Aigyna‚ the Sax-
on, and Hagen, as compared with Heinzel's identification of Hagen
and Aetius? The situation at present with regard to these, as to
many other legendary characters, is this: such identifications rest
upon too bare a basis of detail to amount to positive proof. In the
case of unmistakable historical characters like Ermanric, Theoderic,
and Attila, whose deeds belong to the political history of the world,
and have come down in written record, it is not difficult to follow the
thread os history through mazes os myth and saga. But in the caseos
characters whose deeds have appeared in history either in desultory
jottings, or where recorded more in detail, appear under names differ-
ent from those handed down by legendary tradition, historical identi- ’
fication is peculiarly difficult, and is long in finding general accept-
ance. This is seen in the cases of the master attempts of Vigfusson-
Powell, (Siegsried-Arminiuos) and Heinzel (Hagexi-AEtius).

The Hagen—Aetius identification of Heinzel and the Hagen-Aigyna
parallels given above, though in themselves not conclusive in every
particular, do show this: that the historical back-ground furnished
ample material for the developmentof such legendary characters, and
that there is a strong presumption that the historical saga has com-
bined in such legendary personages, as we know it has in the case of
historical personages, the epic elements of characters widely sepa-
rated in point of time and even locality. Hence therewould be no
inconsistency in supposing that certain traits of the character os
Aigyna served to fortisy the conception os Hagen-Aetius the contem-
porary os Attila: particularly inasmuch as the grouping os events in
the Walther Saga points to a period considerably later than the time
of Attila. Heinzel 37 himselfconcecles the possibility os such anach-

ronism :

“Die Erben der rommanischen Generale Aetius, Aegidius und
Syagrius in Gallien waren die frankischen Konige. Es w'are dem
nach nicht auffallig, wenn die Sagengestalt Hagens Eigenschasten
zeigte‚ welche auf die Merovinger wiesen. Das scheint bei dem
Namen Hagen von Tronje der Fall zu sein.'’

This much seems clear concerning the legendary character, Hagen.
as portrayed in the XValther saga:
