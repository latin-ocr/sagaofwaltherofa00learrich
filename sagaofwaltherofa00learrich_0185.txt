2. HISTORICAL ELEMENTS OF 'sitii xx'AiJrilicit SAGA.

The border land between saga and history is still enchanted ground.
The old historians were fond of making sorays into this ningiv rvnhn
to supply the missing chapters os their chronicles. lat-ss chivzilrons.
though not less bold some adventurous scholars os the present gencr-
ation have donned the veiling-cloak and dragged the facts of history
back into the mists of saga and myth.

It seems time now, if ever. to base the investigation os the saga (and
so sar as possible the myth) upon a firm historicnl foundation. ΗΥ
this procedure alone will it ever be nossible to separate the historica}
from the mythical element. Even this method may not enable us· to

Since the days of the Grimrns and their successors, Lachmann and
Mtillenhoff, the mythical and poetical methods os saga interpretation
have seemed at times to vie in no unequ'al contest with the historical.
At present, however, the historical method is beginning to take firm
hold upon the study both of myth and sage.3 In determining the
historical background osa saga two considerations must be kept

Firstt—That there are various strata or channels os histor& along
which events are transmitted, and that the most trustworthy os these
is the written record. But the range os events recorded in the
chronicles is as narrow as the events are sparse.

Secondly:—That behind or around the written records lies a vast
unwritten chronicle which is transmitted through the memor)- of
succeeding generations. In this latter medium of transmission sarcis
assume the character of living forces, forming new coxnhinations,
taking on new proportions, acquiring new servor and varied colors,
according as the airns, the prejudices‚ the conditions, or the
imagination of the narrator may dictate. It is this second medinm of
