192 WAL THER OF AUQJTAJNE.

shifting significance‚ and the West Gothic rule a general territorial
supremacy. That Alphere’s kingdom, at this early period, was
included, or even centered, in Aquitania Propria is quite possible;
but the general notion os Aquitania extended over the province north
of the Garonne, as we have seen. The designation ofAlphere’s realm
as “Regna Aquitanorum‚'‘ in the waltharius (v. 77), evidently applies
to Aquitania in the larger sense, and not to Aquitania Propria alone.
WVhether lValthen in the earliest form of the Saga, had the same
political importance as that given to him in the Waltharius, we have
no means ofdetermining3 it is natural to surmise that he had. Neither
can we say with certainty whether he was a West Goth or belonged
to some Germanic people closely allied with the Burgundians. That
he was a Boisk, as Heinzel maintains, seems an unfounded hypothesis.
lt would be more reasonable to connect him with some branch related
to the Lombard line whose king, walthari, bears the sarne name a
generation later. This would give us another link in the chain of
evidence for the existence of the Lombard saga of Walthari and
Alphari. The name Alpher occurs in Rabenschlact, 265—267, where
Alplier is sent by Friederich of Ravenna as messenger to Dietrich os
Rern. But perhaps it is enough to have ascertained the political
relations oswalther at the time of the origin os the saga. It will now
be in order to review, briefly, the different conceptions of VValther.

lValtlzer as a lVascon.—The conception of &Valther as a VVascon,
an epithet which may have been applied to him in the original of the
Waltharius, cannot be earlier than the seventh century, when the
Wascons broke forth from their mountain retreat in ancient lVasconia,
in Spain, into Aquitania Propria and formed what the Geographer os
Ravenna 154ἷ calls “ Wasconum patria, quae antiquitus Aquitania
dicebatur.” The establishment of these mountaineers in Aquitania
Propria was practically completed by 626 A. D.‚¹55 though the troubles
between the VVascons and the Aquitanians continued till a much
later period. Thus there is no reason sor regarding VValther as a
VVascon, except in so sar that all Aquitanians were regarded as
XVascons after their country had come to bear the name os the latter.

Walther as tlze son osAlphere (King of the Aquitanians). Turning
to the versions osthe Saga, we find three os them calling VValther the
son os Alphere,—WF, W, NC; this title still distinguishes him in the
M. H. G. Versions‚—VF‚ BD, and presumably GF. Here we have,
doubtless, the early conception os our hero as an Aquitaniam, and a
distinct reminiscence of his royal line. But with the M. H. G. versions
other titles appear.

Waltlzer of Spaha—The conception osWalther as “von Spane,’'
‘⁴ von Spanjelant‚'' is preserved in Nl, VF, BD. This idea of &Valther
