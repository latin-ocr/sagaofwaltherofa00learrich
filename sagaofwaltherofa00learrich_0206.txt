178 WAL THER OF AQUJTAJNE.

these first four3 but it must be remembered that these exploits, too,
are implied, and in fact referred to, in the close os the VValtharius z 101

¹‘ Omnibus et carus post mortem obitumque parentis
Ter denis populum rexit feliciter annis,
Qualia bella dehinc vel quantos saepe triumphos
Ceperit‚ ecce stilus renuit signare retusus.¹'

Having determined approximatelyt he essentia} episodes of the form
of the Saga which constituted the original of the extant versions‚ it
remains to follow the development os this germ and thus trace the
relation of the various versions to this original form and to one
another.

In order to fix a point os departure, it will be necessary, first, to
ascertain which text is the oldest. The analysis given above has
shown conclusively‚ that the Walther Saga is based upon unmistaka-
ble historical events and is to be regarded accordingly as a historical
product. Hence we are justified in applying historical criteria in
ascertaining the age ofthe versions of the Saga.

[Valtharz'us.—-Reserring again to the analysis os contents, the follow-
ing may be deduced as a third generalization in the series os conclu-
sions arrived at above: ¹02

Os all the versions, Waltharius represents most saithsully the
historical events contained in the saga, and is, therefore, apparently
the oldest.¹03

1. Alemannic Version. Attila, King of the Huns, pushes his con·
quests westward, and attacks the nations beyond the Rhine: Franks,
Burgundians, Aquitanians. All os this is essentially historica] as
recorded by the early chroniclers.

2. Old Norse Version. Attila, King os the Huns with his residence
at Susat (or Susa), forms a league with Ermanric. Anachronisrn and
confounding of the persons and plans are apparent, whatever expla-
nation be given of the Ermanric and Susat here mentioned ; ¹04 such
confusion indeed as we are accustomed to see in the epics of the thir-
teenth century.

3. Polish Version. Attila, Ermanric, the Burgundians and Aqui-
tanians are all omitted ; in their place appear Franks, Alemania (Ari-
naldus) and Polonia (wyslaus and Rynga). Here we lose all the
details of the historical setting os the Saga and have a new ethnic
element (the Polish) to account for.

It is evident from thissummary that only in the Latin poem, Wal-
tharius, is a strictly consistent grouping os historical events and char-
acters preserved: the sharp outlines os Attila’s conquest of western
Europe; the participatior] of Burgundians, Franks, and Aqui-
tanians in the struggle with the Huns ; the relation with the Burgun-
dians and Franks; the ultimate victory over the Huns ; the historica}
