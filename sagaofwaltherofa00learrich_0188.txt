the three brothers ‘ruling the East Goths then settled in Pannonia.
When seven years old Theoderic was sent as hostage to the court os
Constantinople‚ where he remained three years. Having returned
with a comitatus of ten thousand rnen, he surprised the Sarmatians
and captured the city of Singidunum (Belgrade). In 473 he aided
Theodemir in settling the East Goths near Thessalonica as allies
(foederati) of the empire. After Theodemir’s death, about 474,
Theoderic waged wars fourteen years against Emperor Zeno and his
rival, the Gothic chieftain Theoderic. son ofTriarius. In 488 Theodeic
began his four years invasion and conquest of Italy. Passing around
the Venitian Gulfhe encountered the Gepidae‚ and at Sontius (Isonzo)
was met by Odoacer. He gained two victories over Odoacer, one at
Sontius (Aug. 28, 489). another at Verona (Sept. 30, 489)3 when Odoacer
fied to Ravenna. Then came the three years of treachery by Tufa, a
deserter from Odoacer, and by Frederic the Rugian, companion of
Theoderic. The Burgundians came to Odoacer's relief, but he was
defeated by Theoderic at the Pine VVood. The siege of Ravenna was
raised Feb. 30, 493, by capitulation ; Theoderic violated the treaty and
slew Odoacer with his own hand March 15, 493. Then followed the
thirty years of Theoderic's peaceful rule in Italy. During this period
he had marshes ‹lrained‚ harbours built, and agriculture improved,
Burdened by remorse for the execution of Boetius and Symmachus

leeoderic I, the West Goth, who is sometimes confused with the
Ostrogoth‚ was chosen successor to Wallia (419, or 420, A. D.), at-
tempted (426) to gain possession of Arles, the center of Roman
authority in Gaul, but was prevented in his attempt by Aetius.
In 436 Theoderic, seeing the Romans engaged in war with the Bur-
gundians, laid siege to Narbonne, but was baffled by the crafty
strategem of Count Litorius. Unwilling to withdraw at the request of
Avitus, and beaten by Litorius, Thederic retreated behind the walls
of Toulouse, whence he again sallied forth against the Romans, as
opportunity offered, and attempted to plant his standard on the banks
of the Rhone, but through Orientius’ intervention he finally made
peace with Aetius.

Theoderic next prepared to attack Genseric, King of the Vandals‚
but the latter encouraged Attila to essay the conquest of Gaul. Theo-
deric, deceived by Attila‘s promises and encouraged by Avitus, joined
the Romans against the Huns, and fell in battle on the Catalaunian
plains, in 451.

Cf. also Theoderic Il who became the King of the West Goths in
453 by the assassination of his brother, Thorismund. Allied with the
Romans, he tried to have Avitus elected Emperor as successor to
Maximus. Theoderic soon afterward crossed the Pyrenees and won a
