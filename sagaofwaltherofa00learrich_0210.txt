2. LATER VERSIONS oF THE SAGA.

The AVovczliczanClzronicle in Lib. ii, written before 1027,¹¹⁶ represents
the torm os the Saga as found in the waltharius, but connects it with
the lise, or local tradition, of an old warrior who entered the cloister
in Novalese? The first part of the Novalician account follows closely
the St. Gall version, which had migrated thither evidently through
monastic intercourse. The career of Walther in the cloister os
Novalese has a parallel in the Legend of St. william, or in the
Chanson de Ceste of ¹ Guillaume au court nez.' The latter was like
W alther an Aquitanian and, like him abducted a princess from a
heathen land. Heinzel1¹7 suggests, that the germ of the account of
the monks Walther and VVilliarn, is possibly to be found in the life of
King‚ or Duke, Hunwald of Aquitaine the son of Eudo, Waishari s
father, and King Pippin’s opponent, who abdicated in the year 745 in
favor of &Vaifhari and entered a cloister; but, after the death of his
son, left the cloister, as an old man, and renewed his opposition to
Pippin3 and finally fled to Italy and fought on the side of Desiderius
againts Charles the Great1 This and other similar legends may have
given color and even episodes to the account of WValtharius, the
Monk; but we doubtless have in the second part of the Novalician
Saga the local tradition of a monk &Valtharius whose early lise was
that of a warrior, and which local tradition was associated later by
the Novalician Chronicler with the account of waltharius manu
sortis,¹18 of the St. Gall version. It is not impossible, too, that we
have in the Novalician &Valther echoes. or associations‚ of the
Lombard King &Valtharh or even of a Lombard variation of the
lValther Saga. If such be the case. it would explain the chronicler’s
presumably unjustifiable 1¹9 excerpts from the Waltharius. We have
already referred to the possible, even probable‚ connection os the
names Alpharius and lValtharius with the Lombard VValthari.

Graz and Vienna Fragme7zts.-In these two M. H. G. Fragments,
we have doubtless, the remains of a M.H.G. Epic of Walther and
Hildegunde. The situation in GF, according to Heinzel's order of
the leaves (which is evidently the correct one), is this: Hagen, having
taken leave of Etzel and his Queen‚ distributes gifts to the Huns, and
overhears Hildegunde making complaint to Walther, who is on the
point of leaving her, and declaring her willingness to follow him.
