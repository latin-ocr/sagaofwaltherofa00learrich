WALTHER OF AQUITAJNE. ¹⁸3

Hagen interrupts the conversation and connsels waltberto marry her,
saying that he (Hagen) was present when they two were betrothed
whereupon lValther, sorry that Hildegunde has so long been without
his attentions‚ assures her of his fidelity.

The narrative in VF, is as follows: Vk'alther and Hildegnnde are
returning from the Huns, and come to Guntlier's land (situated along
the Rhine, with lVorms, presumably. as capital), where the)- are
received by Volker. The latter has come with sixt-x· of his thanes
sroni the Rhine, probably after the hostile encounter and the reconcili-
ation with Giinther mentioned in w (though nothing is said of such
encounter in the Fragment). to conduct them through the lt'asechen
walt t'o Lengers: thither messengers are already sent in advance
to announce Walther's arrival to Alker, his father. As they approach
the city, they are welcomed by Alker and his retinue, whereupcm
preparations are made for the wedding oflValther and Hildegnnde.

Icannot agree with Heinzel¹²0 that 1, 13 is a superfluous interpo-
lation in the poem. The reference is clearly to the combat with the
Huns, which is mentioned in the Thidrekssaga. indeed, the correct-
ness of the situation is clearly shown by lValther's hesitation (2. 16)
to invite Etzel and Helche to the wedding feast. In the invitation to
Etzel and Helche we may find an echo of the reconciliation between
Attila and Ermanric, after the combat (Ths 244); and in the escort of
Yolker, that between Gunther (and Hagen) and Walther at the
XVasgenstein (W, 1405 ff).

Thus we have in the fragments, episodes of the earlier and later
parts os the epic: in GF, preliminaries to the flight from the Huns ;
in VF, the return through Gunther's land to Lengers, and the
reception by Alphere and Hilde preparatory to XVziltlier's wedding
and coronation. Thus, I would be inclined to regard these Fragments
as parts of one and the same M. H.G. poem. The only argument
against this is the apparent difference in strophic structure. The
strophic forms, however, os these two Fragments have so close a
resemblance to one another that the strophes os the separate poenis
differ scarcely more than single strophes in each fragment, hence
they might belong to the same epic. indeed, we have here what
would seem to be a transition strophic form between that of the
Nibelungenlied and that of the Gudrun, characterized by the czesural
and final rhyme os the former, and the closing long line of the latter.
1f the entire poem had been preserved, we should have found in it.
perhaps, a third strophic form of the popular epic. It is likely that
we have here the disconnected remnants of the great German epic of
XValther, or &Valther und Hildegunde, which is so familiarly referred
to in ‘ XValther von der Vogelweide,' ‘Nibelungenlied.' ‘Biterolf und
Dietleib,’ and other epics of the ⁴ Heldenbuch.'

is we now look for the relation to WF, and W os the sorni of the
walther Saga preserved in this original M. H. G. poem. we shall find
