WAL THER OF A QUITA INE. 187

called Aaron. Rupell ¹3³ claims, however, that the ,nonas-ter>- at
Tyniec was founded earlier, by Boleslaw the Great. Here is possibly
a second avenne, leading directly from France, by which German
sagas may have reached Poland in the tenth century, a generatiou
after Ekkehard wrote his waltharius.

The term lVa'aly applied in the Polish version to Walther, has been
shown to be Russian.¹3⁴ This would suggest a migration of the Saga
via Novgorod.¹3⁵ Nehring explains the transference os the Saga to
Poland from chap. 241 of the Thidrekssaga as due to the confusion of
Pfil, Ptili (Apulia), with Pulle (Poland>. Thus he finds in the l‘olish
version a combination osW'alther’s relationship to Ermanric, asin the
Thidrekssaga, with the crossing os the Rhine, as iu XValtharius. Or·
the parallel between the song os walterus and os Horand in Gudrun,
too much, perhaps, has already been made. It is at best an incidental
touch in the saga.

To sum up, then: the XValther Saga may have come into Polaud
through Hanseatic intercourse between Germany and Novgorod, and
from Germany or France, direcssy, through German intercourse with
Poland. The form of the Saga thus introduced may have combined
elements found in the original osEkkehard's lValtharius, and in one
or more of the originals os the Thidrekssaga, and may have had a
separate existence in Poland until it was at length united with the saga
of Vtsyslaus (or perhaps in another form with lVislimierzl. and fmally
localized at Tyniec. The immediate occasion of this localization may
have been, as Nehring and Heinzel think, the epitaph osa certain
Helgunda, which was seen there by Andreas os Zaruow, as late at 1242.
This, however, does not necessarily preclude the earlier existence os
the Polish saga in this region, as Heinzel and Knoop maintain.
1ndeed, it seems not improbable that in the second part of the Polish
saga, we have traces of the version found in the Middle High German
poem ‘Von dem fibelen Wibe.’ This would furnish the reason. in
the two parts of the Polish version, for an earlier connection, than
Knoop 136 is inclined to adniit when he refers the Polish saga to the
period of the Polish reaction against the Germans in the sourteenth
and fifteenth centuries.

VVislaw, of the Polish saga, has been correctly identified with
Wizlan of Greece (Russia), in Dietrichs Flucht ; ¹37 with lVizlan King
os Bohemia⁷ in Biter01f31³8 and VVenezlan King of Poland, in Dietrich
and Wenezlan.1³9
