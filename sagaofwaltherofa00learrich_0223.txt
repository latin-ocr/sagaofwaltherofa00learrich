(Procosius) in the Polish versions.

In the course of the discussion based upon a score os clearly defined
literary survivals os the Walther saga, we have shown that the
elements os the Saga are essentially historical, belonging, for the
most part. to the period of heroic struggle os the Germanic peoples os
the West with the Huns ; that the original form of the Saga probably
developed as early as the fifth century; assumed a strongly Frankish-
Burgundian color of the Merovingian period in the Waltharius
versi0n; became itself the theme of a M. H. G. epic 3 was connected
with the great heroic cycles of the ¹ Nibelungenlied,' os the epic
accounts of Ermanric‚ Theoderic, and Charlemagne. Thus we have
justified the view that &Valther of Aquitaine belongs to the historical
group of heroic characters with whom all mediaeval tradition associ-
ated him, and not to the realrn of myth and sable.
