WAL THER OF A QUITA [NE. ¹⁸9

the Saga os lValthen and that os Hotherus rests upon a misunder-
standing of the name Mimming.¹⁴3

Much that has been said against Rischka’s method applies with
equal weight to Rydberg'sru mythical interpretation, which makes
&Valther represent Ivaldi in Grimnismal and Snorra Euda. with the
following coincidences: the names XValther :ind lvaldi; Walther's
skill as a spearman; the abduction of Hildegunde; the combat with
Gunther. This interpretation, like that os Rischka, rests upon the
assumption that the Heroic saga developes out os myth; or, as
Heinzel 1⁴5 puts it:

“auf der meiner Meinung nach unbeweisbaren und nach aller

Ersahrung hochst unwahrscheinlichen Voraussetzung, (lass es in weit
entsernten Urzeiten ein festes System germanischer Mythologie
oder eigentlich Theologie gegeben habe, in der es keine Analogie-
wirkungen in den Vorstellungen, keine Unklarheiten und Wider-
spriiche gegeben habe.‘'
Apart from Heinzel's refutation of Rydberg's argument, suffice itto say
that the fact that two Northern myths furnish sufficient coincidences
for the basis os such superficial identifications isin itselfa strong argu-
ment against both Rischka and Rydberg.

Miillenhoff’s interpretation os the Saga of XValther as a recasting of
the mythical Saga of Hilde(⁴ Zs. f..d. A.' 12, 2743 30, 235 ff.) rests upon
accidental coincidences, and has in reality no real claim upon our
consideration here. Heinzel (lValthersage 93) has demonstrated the
weakness of the argument by showing that these coincidences are to
be explained by the influence osa mythical upon a historica] Saga.

Historical Identification.—Fortunately, the tendency now toward
the historical method of saga-treatment is gaining ground. All the
more prominent interpretations of the XValther Saga have rested,
more or less firmly, upon a historical basis. The eyes os most
investigators have turned toward Aquitaine for the home os lValther.
The most trustworthy traces of the Saga certainly point toward the
West or South, not toward the East or North. Fauriel’s ¹46 view that
Walther was a Gallo-Roman, was opposed by Geyder ¹⁴7 on the
ground that the Germans would not likely have celebrated a hostile
hero, which Walther must have been, if he had been a Gallo-Roman.
Miillenhoff’5148 modification of Fauriel’s view—that lValther was
originally the ruler os Gaul in the epic age—is, if anything, less definite
than Fauriel's original explanation. It might be objected to both os
these views, that none of the versions os the Saga make any specific
reference to Gallo-Roman, or Gallie, personages or events as having
importance in the issues treated in the Saga.
