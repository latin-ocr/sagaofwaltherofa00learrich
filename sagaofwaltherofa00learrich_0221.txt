WAL THER OF AQUITAINE. 193

grew up, doubtless, after the establishment of the Spanish Mark by
Charles the Great, 801. The confusion of Spain with the Spanish
Mark, is one that could easily be made by the popular mind. It is to
be noted, too, that he is called both ‘der kiinec von Spanjelant' (BD,
576) and ‘der vogt von Spanyge‘ (VF, 1, 10, 1); thus preserving
reminiscences of his early rank as ‘Kiinec' brought out in the
Waltharius.

Walther os Kerlingen.—WValther is designated by the title ‘von
Kerlingen' in BD, AT, ‘geborn von Kerlinc’ RFx, and DF. This
conception developed, doubtless, in the time of the Carlovingians and
was perfectly consistent with that of &Valther as ‘ von Spfiness when
the latter was regarded as identical with the Spanish Mark. But just
here there seems to have come in a serious confusion; sor in BD
Walther is called ‘Alpkeres Kint,’ ¹ Kiinec von Spanjelant,' and ‘der
von Karlingen,’ but resides at Paris (see Analysis). It is plain that
the hero's royal titles were all before the BD poet and that to him
Karlingen meant France, whose capital was Paris. Thus the confusion
of Spain, a part of Kerlingen, with the whole Frankish realm is easy
and natural.

Walther os Lengers.—It is worthy of note that the designation of
Walther as ‘ von Lengers ‘ and ‘der Lengesaere,’ occurs only in VF,
DF and Rs respectively. Heinzel¹56 suggests two possible expla-
nations of the choice of Lengers as Walther's residence: it may have
been due to the fact that this city became prominent through its Bishop
XValther, son of Duke Hugo 11. of Burgundy, and a possible confusion
of Bassiniacum with WVasconia ; or the saga may have been attached
to Lengers through the Sarmatae who settled there in the fourth
century and were regarded, like VValther, as fugitives of the Huns. It
seems more likely, however, that Lengers came to be regarded as the
home of Walther at the period when it formed the most prominent
border city os Carolingia (Kerlingen) on the old time-worn route
through the Vosges, when Carolingia, the realm ofCharles‚ bordered
Lotharingia, that of Lothar (cf. Droysen, Hist. Atlas). That Lengers
was a Burgundian city of the Vosges may have favored its choice as
Walther’s home (cf. Heinzel, ‘Walthersage,‘ 70).

lValtlter of tlze Wzsgenstein.--This designation is found in R, Ths,
and doubtless came from the scene of Walther's combat with
Gunther's men. Vosagus, as the pass is called in W, is traceable to
to the Vosegus ι57 and Vogesus of Roman times. Compare Lucan,
Pharsalia Ι. 397-8;

‘¹ Castraque quae Vogesi curvam super
ardua rupem
Pugnaces pictis cohibebant Lingones
armis''
