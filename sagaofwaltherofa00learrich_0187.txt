fratres eius Sarus et Ammius (lanuuius. Aminus. Amnius) Germanae
obitum vindicantes, Ermanarici latus ferropetierunt2 quo vulnvre sae-

ricus tam vulneris dolore quam etiam Hunnorum incursionibus non

It is evident at a first glauce that jordanes has drawn his account,
in part at least, from an already well-developcd Ermanric saga, but
a comparison of his account with that of Ammianus will show that
certain trustworthy historical facts are common to both and constitute
a firm historical basis for the Ermanric saga (cf. Ths. below). what
the later chroniclers-Flodoardus (⁴ Hist. Eccles. Remensis,' 4, 5);
Chronicon Quedlinburgense (Menken, ¹55. Rer. Germ.,‘ iii, 170);
Eckehardus (‘ Chronicon Urspergense,’ p. 85²); Otto von Freisingen
(Chronicon v, 3); Saxo Grammaticus (Stephan, L. viii, p. 154—157)—
have to say of Ermanric, where not based upon Ammianus and
jordanes, must be regarded as history highly tinged with the color of
mediaeval tradition, and belongs rather to the Saga than to the history
of Ermanric.

Herminericus, one of the two Roman Consuls in the year 465, may
be mentioned here as having had some possible influence upon the
traditional account of the great Gothic King Ermanric of the fourth
century. 5 This Herminericus was the son of Aspar, a Goth or Alan,

and survived Aspar, who was assasinated in 471, A. D. 6

Hermeric, leader of the Suevi in 411, A. D., may possibly have
been confused in the popular mind with 'the somewhat similar
name os the Gothic Ermanric (Hermanaric). The record of Her-
meric's career is brief. He appears as leader of the Suevi 411, A. D.‚
when they, with the Asding Vandals under Gunderic occupied Gal-
licia.7 Hermeric and his Suevi were attacked by Gunderic and the
Asding Vandals in 419, A. D.‚ and shut in among the Nervian moun-
tains for a year.8 Hermeric led the Suevi into the territory abandoned
by the Vandals to Genseric3 but Hermeric was defeated by Genseric
near Merida and, compelled to flee, perished in the waters of the
Guadiana.9

mendeno, the East Goths—The account given os Theoderic the
East Goth by Jordanes,10 Procopius‚¹1 Anonymus Valesii‚12 briefly

summarized, is as follows:
Theoderic born about 454, A. D.. was the son of Theodemir‚ one os
