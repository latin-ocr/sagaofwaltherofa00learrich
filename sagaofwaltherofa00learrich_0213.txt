WALTHER OF AQcs'lTAlNE. ¹⁸5

in the Waldere‚ connected the sagas of walther. Weland. and
Theoderic, and lived on in the German songs referred to in the
, prologue of the Thidrekssaga. In the thirteenth century, particularlv
from the time of Haakon Haakonson sorward. the intercourse between

’ Scandinavia and southern Europe resulted in a new importation of

 

German sagas t'o the north. On the other hand, the intercourse with
Novgorod, through the commerce of the Hanseatic League. brought
the north of Europe into touch with Russia and Byzantium. Hence we
find. as might be expected. in the Thidrekssaga, a thirteenth century
fusion of all these sources into the prose narrative of Theoderic.

The Old Swedish version is evidently very closely related to the
Old Norse Thidrekssaga. According to Hylten-Cavallius,¹²⁴ it is an
abbreviated translation of the Old Norse text or MS. (⁴⁴ en forkortad
osversattning af den fornnorska sagan, markligt nog. utarbetad effer
just samma skinbok '’) worked out between 1449 and 1476, probably
soon after the former date.

Polislz Versions.—The so-called Chronicle of Boguphal, or Great
Polish Chronicle as it has been called since Warmski. has been found
by the researches oswarmski12s and thrzynski ¹²⁶ to be a compilation
of the fourteenth century. .- For the earlier periods, this compilation
drew frorn Vincentius Kadlubek, or sources derived from him: and
for the period between 1²¹7 and 1272, from the Great Polish Annals,
in the composition of which Boguphal. Bishop of Posen (d. 1253).
seems to have had a smaller share than Godyslaw-Baszko, the Custos
of Posen, who lived till the end of the thirteenth century. Though
Vincentius served as a source of chapter twenty-nine of the Clironicle.
it must be remembered that the section of this chapter containing the
WValther saga is one of a large number of accounts for which no source
has as yet been agreed upon. There is some probability that the
account of Walther and Hildegunde was interpolated at a later period.
as it is related with events of the twelfth century, and not with the
legendary accounts of the early heathen period,¹²7 to which the
chronicle refers this saga. Heinzel1²8 is, perhaps, not far from the
truth in supposing that the chronicler drew, in part at least. from oral
sources—a prose tradition, or even a lay after the order of the Danish
‘⁸ Kaempeviser.’‘

But when we examine the later Polish accounts of Walther and
Hildegunde, we find reference toother sources. Paprocki mentions
as his authorities an Anonymus (thought by Semkovicz‚¹²9 to he the
same as the Great Polish Chronicle. but considered by Heinzel, with
better reasons. to be one of the originals of the Chronicle) and
Andreas of Zarnow, to whom are to be ascribed variationis found in
