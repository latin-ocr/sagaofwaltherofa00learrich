WALTHER OF AQUJTAINE. 181

Haganin, and others. Since Grinnn's time, this view has gained
ground. The results osSchweitzer¹¹2 sortis)- al‘resh this theory by the
addition of other examples 3 as, sor example, Caput attolens scrutatur
(535'):Hebet das haupt und horcht: Absi! quod rogitas mentis depone
pauorem (551)=Ferne sei . . . . sorderest . . . .sorcht. So, too. verses
which correspond to lines in the Waldere and Nibelungenlied:

Svfitffig aud sveordvund secg lister fidhrum=
C macutus el laesus vir aller post alterum (cecidit).

Lis forle 'san odhdhe lange dnm . . . .
Vitam linquere vel longam gloriam . . , .

Das liebe mit leide ze jungiste bone
Amoris dolorem novissimam mercedem esse,

2. The actual existence os such alliterative fragment os the Saga as
preserved in the Waldere3

3. ‘l'he survival of the Saga in the heroic form os the M. H. G. epic;
as, in the Graz and Vienna Fragments;

4. The indirect evidence derived from the association os this Saga
with other M. H. G. epics. Ι

It seems probable that Ekkehard 1. chose'sor his Latin poem the
central episodes of his original (chief among which was the comhat),
and omitted such as did not harmonize with his conception of epic
treatment. This is clearly indicated at the close os the poem; for
example, where he sums up all of VValther‘s subsequent exploits os
thirty years in half a dozen verses. In like manner, he may have
omitted such references to the Theoderic and Weland Sagas as the
waldere contains. But that he essentially changed, or invented,
episodes is the less likely as his main purpose seems to have been
skillful translation into epic form rather than literary creation. That
he should clothe the Saga with the classical adorament of Virgil or
Prudentius as Peiper113 has shown, and give it the coloring os
Monastic lise of his time, as Geyderm has presented, and invest it
with the geographical and historica] setting of a later period, is what
we should naturally expect. But when due allowance has been made
for such accretions and modificafions, we shall have left what may be
regarded as the essential kernel of the original German version of
the Saga. This original was probably the Upper German (Alemannic)
form, while the waldere represents the Low German (Saxon?) form.
Heinzel’ssss objection that the primitive type os the ‘Waltharius‘
cannot be of Alemannic origin because the poet represents Attila as
passing the Araris and Rhodanus on his way from &Vorms to Chailons
is, as the critic himself admits, only one evidence of the author’s
unfamiliarity with the geography of the region. Thus, we have in the
‘waltharius‘ a tenth century adaptation os an original German
version, either contemporary with that os the Waldere, or slightly
later.
