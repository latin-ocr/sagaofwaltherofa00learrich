WAL THER‘OF AQUITALVE. 171

The name os Childechinda, the daughter of Chilpericus l occurs iu
early Frankish history.⁴9 While this sorm can scarcely he identified
with that os Hildegunde‚ it indicates together with those mentioned
above, that the name Hildegunde belongs to Frankish-Burgundian
soil; and hence need not be a poetic creati0n‚ pure and simple (as
Heiuzel would seem to suggest.) in imitation ot' the forms Hilde
Hildeburg, Hildeswidh, Helisant‚ in similar tales (¹⁶ in den alinlichen
Erzahlungen nachgebildet ’') ; 50 but like these is doubtless traceable
to Burgundian-Frankish tradition osthe sixth century. This, at least.
is evident: that the Hildeguude of the lValther Saga harmonizes with
the historical elements and conditions out of which the Saga grew.
and is not in any version of the Saga a vague, mythical character. but
a genuine, legendary personage os flesh and blood, reflecting actual
history.

Alphere.——The name os Alphere, father of XValther, and king os the
Aquitaniaus, (according to the lValtharius) seems to have escaped
the old chrouiclers. San-Marte51 recognizes the name in Alf or Half,
son os Hialprek and spouse of Hiordisa‚ Sigurd¹s mother. This Alf
is not to be consouuded with Alf the Old, son os L‘lfr, mentioned in
Helga-Kvida i, 215, and Hyndluliod.5² The Nornagest Saga 53 gives
us more reliable information concerning Hialprek. It calls him king
in Frankland, and this evidently refers to the historical Hilpericus
(Chilpericus, 561-581). Compare also Hilpericus who ruled contem-
poraneously with his brother Gundiocus as king os the Burgundians,
from about 437 to 47o.54 Here again we find ourselves in the midst of
Burgundian-Frankish events, as in the case of the names Hagen.
Heriricus and Hildegunde discussed above.

thether there be a family connection between this Alsos the Edda
and Alphere must remain a matter of conjecture. jacob Grimm 55
cites names of similar ending (Folchere, Guntherel-xi’hich, by the
way, belong to the Burgundian-Frankish region—and suggests that
M. H. G. form Alpher, instead of the regular form Alphere (zGoth.
Albharis) may be due to confusion with Alpker (zGoth. Albgais).

There remains, however, another point to consider: whether the
name Alphere is to be connected with the Lombard heroic cycle of
which Alboin (AElfwine, Elswine) is the central figure. A number of
considerations make it quite probable that there was some connection
between the two:

1. The similarity of the first element of the names Alphere (<Alb—
hari) and Alboin (Alb—wine).

2. The frequent intercourse between the Lombards, Burgundians
and Franks. ⁸
