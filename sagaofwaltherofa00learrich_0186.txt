158 WAL THER OF AQUITAINE.

transxnission, tradition, which constitutes the chief source of the saga ;
and it is as much the duty of the investigator to keep in view the trend
of tradition underlying the development of saga as it is his duty to
hold fast to his historical moorings. In short, in the study of culture
and belief in whatever form, it is quite as important to know what
tradition says as to know what recorded history recounts os the great
men and events of the past. But in order to separate the historical
and mythical element os the saga, we must begin with history.

The Saga of Walther oquuitaine contains clearly recognizable his-
torica] elenents. Before proceeding to the treatment of the so-called
mythical elements, it will be well to eliminate and examine the his-
torical. The following characters have a well-authenticated histori-
cal record: Emmnric, Dietric‚ Attila, Helche (Eriza). Gibico,
Guntharius. It will be in place here to recall the essential facts of
their career as transmitted by history, in order to secure a suitable
point of departure.

Ermanric.—Ammianus Marcellinus, Ermanric's contemporary,

gives the following account os him ;

Igitur Hunni pervalis Alanorurn regionibus, quos Greuthungis con-
fines Tanaitas consuetudo nominavit, interfectisque multis et spoliatis,
reliquos sihi concordandi fide pacta iunxerunt: eisque adiunctis, con-
fidenti-is Ermenrichi late potentes et uberes pagos repentino impetu
perruperunt. bellicossimi regis, et per multa variaque fortiter facta
vicinis nationibus formidati. Qui vi subitae procellae perculsuS,
quamvis manere fundatus et stabilis diu conatus est, impendentium
tamen diritatem augente vulg-atius fama, magnorum discriminum
metum voluntaria morte sedavit (31, 3.)

Jordanes’ account of Ermanric is briefly as follows:

Some time after the death of Geberic‚ who was the King of the
united Gothic peoples about 331, Ermanric (Ermanaricus) the
noblest of the Amali, followed as King of the Goths. He subjugated
many northern peoples to his rule, so that the old historians fittingly
compared him to Alexander the Great. After having conquered the
‘⁶ Gothos, Scythias, Thuidos in Aunxis, Vasinabroncas Merens, Mor-
densimnis, Caris, Rocas, Tadzan‚ Athual Navego, Buhegentas, Col-
das‚'' 4 he marched against the Heruli. Having subjugated these he
vanquished in turn the Veneti, Antes (Entes), Sclavi (Sclaveni), the
Aestes along the coast of the German Ocean, ‘⁴ so that he ruled oyer
all the peoples of Scythia and Germania as over his own subjects.”

The tragic end of Ermanric is thus related by hirn as follows:

Quod genus expeditissimum multarumque nationum grassatorem
Getae ut viderunt, paviscunt suoque cum rege deliberant, qualiter
tali se hoste subducant. Narn Ermanaricus, rex Gothorum, licet, ut
superius retulimus, multarum gentium extiterat triumphator, de Hun-
norum tamen adventu dum cogitat. Rosomonorum (Rasomonorum
Rosomorum, Roxolanorum) gens infida quae tuncinter aliosilli famu-
latum exhibebat. tali eum nanciscitur occasione decipere. Dum enirn
quandam mulierem Sunilda (Sunihil, Sunielh) nomine ex gente merno-
rata pro mariti fraudulento discessu rex surore commotus equis sero-
cibus inligatam incitatisque cursibus per diversa divelli praecipisset‚
