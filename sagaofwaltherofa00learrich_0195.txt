WAL THER OF A (JQJTAJNE. 167

Besides these, the general accord that both u ere great warriors md
commanders, and thatin the¹ Nibelungenlied' Hagen is Scl1armci-s
ter, as Aetius was magiwstu miluum.

Other considerations' in Heinzel’ s argument are perhaps ex en more
weighty than some os the coincidences noted above. Such are:

1. Identification os Aldrian, Hagen’s father, with Alaric Ι, the &vest
Gothic king, at whose court Aetius lived from about his tenth to his
fourteenth year, Alaric's affection sor A'e'tius thus giving rise to the
popular tradition that he was Aetius‘ father.

2. The possible confusion· ιη Epic tradition of this Alaric with Alaric
ΙΙ, who ruled in Gaul and fell at Vougle while fighting against the
Franks, in the year 507

VVhether Heinzel' s identification of Hagen with Aetius be accepted
or rejected, it must remain a masterly attempt at historical interpre-
tation os obscure legendary elements.—-Scherer’s identification of
VVa'lther with Aetius will be discussed below in connection with Wal-
ther.

Is‘we turn, now, to find the name of Hagen in history, our eye falls
first'upon one closely resembling Hagen, Aigyna (Aighyna, Aiginus)
theTIprinciple-events of whose career, so far as they are recorded, are
the following : 30

In 626 A. D. Aigyna guarded, as duke, the Frankish frontier along
the banks os the Garonne‚ against the inroads of the XVascons. In
the same year he effected the banishment of Palladius, and his son
Seducus, Bishop ofToloso, for having been accomplices in the upris-
ing of the VVascons. The following year he allowed his rival.
Ermenar, to be assassinated at Clichy, thus giving rise to a seditious
outbreak. In the year 635 heled a corps of the Burgundian—Frankish
army (probably his own retainers) against XVasconia, and afterward
conducted the humiliated &Vascons to the palace of Clichy to obtain
their pardon of Dagobert.

This Aigyna, whom Fredegar calls “a noble Saxonss 'seems to be
the nearest approach in these early historical records to the Hagano
(Haganus, Agano:. ‘Chron‚ Noval. ’) os the &Valther Saga. It is not
impossible that some of the situations in this Saga find their expla-
nation in the career of Aigy na. The following considerations may

be suggested here:
1. Aigyna is a noble Saxon ; 31
2. Aigyna takes part in the Burgundian·Frankish attack upon the

.32
wgsffixgz'na, as duke under Frankish authority,would explain Hagen's

coming from Troja (Tronje) ; 33
