170 WAL THER OF AQUITAINE.

Further we have mention in Gregorius Turonensis 46 of Chararicus
king of the Suevi in Spanish Callida, and father of Theodemirus. It
was in the time ofTheodemirus‚ who was made king about 559, that
the Suevi were converted to the Catholic Faith.⁴7 There may have
been some confusion in the popular mind between Chararicus king of
the Morini and Chararicus king of Gallicia. The geographcal position
os the latter would suggest such confusion.

It seems not at all improbable that Chararicus, as Frankish King
ruling over the Burgundian territory aster its subjection to Frankish
authority, should have come to be regarded as King of the Burgun-
dians. This is the inore plausible, as the confusion os Frankish and
Burgundian relations is already evident in the &Valther Saga, where
the Burgundian Gundicarius is represented as King of the Franks.
Is, then, we have succeeded in identifying the Heriricus of the saga
with the Chararicus osGregorius Turonesis we shall have established
another bond of the close relationship of our saga with its historical

background.

Hildegzmde.—In the case of Hildegunde, whom the Saga calls the
daughter of Heriricus, the actual historical background is not so clear.
The name itself‚ however, together with the name os Hilde, Alker's
queen, and presumably &Valther’s mother, points unmistakably to
Eurgundian—Frankish origin. The name Hilde is an almost constant
quantity in Burgundian-Frankish history of the Merovingian period,
as indeed os the Sagas connected with the period. We need but
recall some of the most prominent Chlotchilde, Brunhilde, Balthilde,
not to mention the names of men, Childebert, Childerich. S0‚ too,
the second part of the name occurs in Fredegunde and the ethnic
name itself Burgunde.

The coincidence of the first part of the name Hildegunde with
Hilde, the presumable mother of Wasther, suggests the close ethnica]
and political relationship os Burgundians and Aquitanians at the time
when the Alemannic version of the Saga developed. Compare the
fact that Heriricus and Alphere had betrothed their children in early
childhood. This may indicate also a family relationship existing
between the two Kings.

One other point remains to be noted here: that the form Hildegunde
contains the stem element of the name Hildic048(11di‚co) Attila’s last
spouse. Itis not unlikely that this may have given rise to the name
os this royal hostage, Hildegunde, who held such a responsible posi-
tion at Attila’s court. Then‚ too, the last fatal feast of Attila on the
night of his nuptials with Ildico, may have left its traces in the feast
which Walther and Hildegunde prepare—note in particular the

potion, the long sleep.

48 The masculine form corresponding to Hildico is borne by one of the two Vandals,
Praepositae Heldicus and Cubadus. Cf. Dahn, ‘ Konige der Germanen,' i, 217, 232, 236.
