184 WAL THER OF AQUJTAINE.

that the ethnical situation agrees essentially with that of WF. In
VF, Gunther is called ‘⁶ vogt von Rine '' (1, 19), and his land is “der
Burgonde lant,‘’ as in WF, B 14, he is called “wine Burgenda,'’
while in W he is ‘⁶ King os the Franks.” Thus, VF corresponds in
situation to Nl, BD, DF, and Rs, and belongs, doub‘tlessy to the older
form of the Saga. It is scarcely probable that the M.H‚G. poem
descended directly from the form of the Saga as contained in the
waltharius. The former would rather seem to be a more direct
successor of the original popular form os the Saga, of which the
waldere poem was the Low German (Saxon) version.

lez‘drekssaga,—-The Old Norse Thidrekssaga belongs, doubtless‚
to the first half os the thirteenth century, to the reign of King Haakon
Haakonson. The language and style clearly indicate that it cannot
be later than this period.121 From the mode os treatment and order
of the tales, it is evident that the Old Norse narrator drew from
different versions of the Saga. No particular written form is mentioned
as the source of the Old Norse version, but it appears from the pro-
logue, which has been regarded as the work of the author ofthe Old
Norse recension,¹²² that at least two different sources furnished
material sor the saga:

1. Sagas or accounts os German men;
2. Old poenis, or songs;
both of which sources are mentioned in the prologue as follows :¹²3

“Thessi saga er samansett eptir sogn hyffeskra manna, en sumt as
heirra kvaeaum er skemta skal rikum monnum ok fornort voru begar
eptir tinindum sem segir i pessari sogu. Ok ,bo at ῥυ takir einn mann
or hverri borg um allt Saxland. Tha munu bessa sogu allira eina leia
segia. en Pui vallda peirra hin sornu kvaeffi.”

This period represents the high-water mark os saga telling. As
another passage from the prologue indicates, the same os this Saga
traversed almost all the lands os Europe:

“Saga ,hessi hefzt ut a Pul ok serr noriJr um Lunghardi ok Fenidi.
iSvava. iUngaria. i Pulina land. i Ruzia. i Vindland. i Daumork ok
Sx'ihiod. urn allt Saxoniam ok Frakland ok vestr um Valland ok
Hispaniam.'⁷

The Thidrekssaga contains some peculiar and striking divergences ε
VValther is the son of Ermanric's sister, and not os Alpherer as in WF,
W, VF. Hildegunde is the daughter oflarl Ilias osGreece. Ermanric.
Attila and Theoderic are regarded as contemporaries. All this
harmonizes in the main with the anachronisms of the German
Theoderic epics of the thirteenth century. '

1f we now look for the relation of the Thidrekssaga to the Waldere.
we shall find a possible connection in the references to the Weland and
Theoderic stories. The probable relation may be stated somewhat as
