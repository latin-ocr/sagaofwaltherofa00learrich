164 WALTHER OF AQUJTAINE.

supplicanti dedit: qua non potitus est, siquidem illum Chuni cum
populo suo ac stirpe deleverunt.'' 24

Gundicarius’ defeat by Attila in the following year (436) is men-
tioned by Paulus Diaconus in his “ Libello de Episcopis Mettensibus ’

as follows z

“Eo igitur tempore [436 A. D.]‚ cum reverendus his Praesul vitam
cunctis virtutibus decoratum duceret, Attila Rex Hunnorum omnibus
belluis crudelior, habens multas barbaras nationes suo subjectas
dominio, postquam Gundigarium Burgundionum Regem sibi occurren-
tem protriverat ad universas deprimendas Gallias suae saevitiae
relaxavit habenas.’' 25

The same event is referred to in the ‘ Historia Miscella' by Paulus
Diaconus :

“Attila itaque primo impetu, mox ut Gallias ingressus est Gundi-
carium regem Burgundiorum sibi occurrentem protrivit, pacemque ei
supplicanti dedit.”

In this account of Attila's subjugation of the Burgundians (436),
there is doubtless confusion of the overthrow of Gundicarius by the
Huns, serving as Roman mercenaries (436), with the expedition of
Attila (451).26 May not the two divisions of Attila's army in 451 have

further confused the account?

sztia'rius.—Olympiodorus of Thebes, states 27 that Guntiarius
(Greek form Guntiarios) praefect (φύλαρχος) of the Burgundians, and
Goar, praefect os the Alans, proclaimed Jovinus Emperor at Mainz 411,
or 412. That this Guntiarius is the same as Gundicarius mentioned
above, seems probable. In the minds of later generations at any rate
they would naturally have become identical.

It is possible, also, that traces of other famous characters of the
same, or similar names, have been added to some of the traditional
accounts of Gundicarius; as, for example, of Gundericus, the king of
the Vandals. ,

Gandefz'cus, King of the Vandals, from 406-428. The main facts of
Gundericus’ career are the following: In the year-419 at the head of
the Asdings, he attacked Hermericus, the leader of the Suevi, and
held them shut in sor a year among the Nerva Mountains. Having
united the Alans to his kingdom, he formed a host superior to the
Suevi, Goths and Romans. In the year 422 his Vandals and Alans
defeated Castinus, the Roman magister militum, together with his
XVest Gothic mercenaries, compelling them to fiee, with the loss of
twenty thousand men, to Tarragona. In the year 425 Gundericus
made conquest of the cities of Carthagena and Sevilla. About two
years later, 427 or 428, Gundericus perished in battle, probably while
fighting against the Suevi. According to tradition, he was visited by
God's chastisment for plundering the churches in Sevilla.28
