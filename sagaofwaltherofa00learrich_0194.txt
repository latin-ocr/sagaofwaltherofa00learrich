3. LEGENDARY ELEMENTS

In addition to the historical elements, which are readily identified,
the Walther Saga contains a class of characters which, doubtless,
reflect actual history, but which can only be indistinctly traced in the
historical records handed down to us. To regard these characters as
purely legendary is to ignore the relation of history-to tradition, and
to misconceive the processes by which the historical Saga is devel·
oped. On the other hand, to begin the interpretation os such charac-
ters by tracing thern in the Eddic Lays is to complicate the problem
and vitiate the conclusions3 because these Lays, though in many cases
containing very early forms of the Sagas, present these characters in
combination with distinctively Northern legendary and mythical ele-
ments.

Thus the characters which we designate as Legendary: Hagen,
Heriricus, Hildegunde, Alphere, Walther; and the knights, who
attack Walther in single combat at the Wasgenstein: Camelo,
Ekevrid‚ Eleuter (Helmnod), Gerwicus‚ Hadawart‚ Kimo (Scaramun-
dus), Patavrid, Randolf‚ Tanastus‚ Trogus, Wurhardus-if not trace-
able in historica] record, are at least the outgrowth osa historical past
and not inventions, pure and simple. This is clear from the faint
historical traces of the names, which may be briefly stated here.

Hagen. Heinzel29 has made a skillsul attempt to identify Hagen
with Aetius, and the coincidences between the two he sums up briefly
as follows ;

1. The name Hagathiau for Hagen’s father in the Walthariu53

2. The repeated sojourns of Aetius among the Huns, as hostage
and fugitive, and the sojourn os his son there as hostage;

3. The historical position of Aetius; first as friend, and then as foe
of the Huns: consequently as friend of the Germanic foes os the Huns,
the Burgundians;

4. The Burgundians fighting on the side of Aetius against Attila,
in the year 451;

5. The Germanizing of Aetius by his marriage with a Gothic prin-
cess;

6. The diplomacy os Aetius, which might appear as the cowardice
of Hagathiu ;

7. The accusation os Aetius as the assassin os Attila through
Hildico3

8. The avenging os Attila’s murder by his subjects.
