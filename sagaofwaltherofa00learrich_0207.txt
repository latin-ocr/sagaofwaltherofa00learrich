So, too, the hero's career receives the most consistent treatment
in the Latin poem. All the principle episodes of his activity are in
keeping with the trend of actual events underlying the Saga. Nor i„-
the hero called upon to play roles which lie without the sphere of his
skill as seems to be the case in the contest with Thetleifr in the Thid-
rekssaga. Moreover, in the Latin poem there is a clearer discrimina-
tion in the treatment of Saga cycles; a conspicuous absence of that
indiscriminatejnmble which permits Ermanric, Attila, and Theoderic
of Verona, to appear as contemporaries in the Thidrekssaga. Al}
these points combined, would lead us to look to the Latin poem as the
clearest and earliest extant form of the Saga ; and as an evidence of
the great age, and excellent preservation of the original elementa
which belong to the fifth century.105

Wzldere.—The MS. of the Waldere Fragments dates from the ninth
century, which gives this version of the Saga the appearance of a
greater age than that which can be claimed for the lValtharius. The
question then is z which is older, the &Valdere or the XValtharius form
os the Saga? If we now compare the XValdere with the corresponding
episode of the Waltharius we shall find that, while there is essentia]
agreement, there are important differences between thern. The
situation of the Waldere is apparently this: &Valther returning with
treasure from the Huns is attacked by Gunther (unjusuy, because
Walther has made generous terms of peace); one after another of
Gunther‘s men has fallen in single combat with &Valther3 at length
comes Hagen’s turn to fight with Walther. Here we begin to
encounter difficulties3 two different points of view regarding the
speaker in A, are presented. The one which has most general
acceptance is, that Hildigunde addresses Walther.¹06 If this he
assumed, the speech would seem to have reference to the moment in
the combat when Hagen has attacked Walther (W, 1287 ff.) and
shivered the latter's sword (W., 1374—5); whereupon Hildegunde
inspires lValther with fresh courage, reminding him that the
choicest os gists lent him sor his and her aid yet remains‚ referring
probably to the sword which Gunther had refused.

According to the other view os the situation as represented by
Heinzel, the speaker is a companion warrior of lValther and not
Hildegunde, since the references in the speech to Walther’s former
combats do not fittingly come from a women. If the speaker is not
