WAL THER OF AQUJTAJNE. 175

as a record os the designation iu history, and thus furnish some indi-
cation as to where the name. or group of names. left the most lasting
impress on the historical record.

Waltlzer’s Opponenls. Of the eleven knights. or warriors of
Guntharius‚ who meet VValtharius in single combat, we have but
vague information. As W. Miiller87 has pointed out, there are
seven who belong doubtless to Frankish or Frankish-Burgundian
territory: Camelo os Metz (581); Kimo. son of Camelo's brother.
called also Scaramund(6863; Hadawart os &Vorms (782, 831); Patavrid.
son Hagen’s sister (846); Qerwitus (or Gerwicns), formerly count “in
Wormatiae campis ''; Trogunt (or Trogus) of Strassburg (¹009)ss
Tanastus os Speier.

Attempts have been made to identify some ol* these warriors more
closely. The name Camelo, is generally admitted to signify ‘der
Alte‚' and its bearer was also called Ortwin according toJ. Grimm,88
Miillenhoff89 and Scheffel-Holder.90 Thus Ortwip, ‘ der Junge ' os the
Nibelungenlied, would correspond to Camelo's nephew Kimo
(=Keim‚ ‘der Jung ' ?) San-Marte thinks that Kimo's additional des-
ignation, Scaramund, points to other legendary accounts, and refers
to the termination -mund in such names as Sigmund (who is a Frank
in the Edda) and Faramund, the first Frankish King.9¹ To Tanastus
is assigned by Sa11-Marte92 a Frankish, or Celtic-Frankish origin, as
is seen in lVindegast‚ lVisogast, Arogast, Salegast. Some ost the
remaining names have been tentatively located: Ekevrid, the Saxon,
refers according to w. Miiller 93 to the war between the West Goths and
Saxons in the time of Euric. This author bases his view upon the
account of Sidonius Appolinaris (8, 6, 9). who reports that Euric, the
XVest Goth, vanquished the Saxons, who had come in ships to Aqui-
tania. Lachmann would assign Randolf and Helmnod (or member,
to lVorms. J. Grimm and W. Miiller‚ with better reason, would
identisy Randolfwith Randolsof Milan (vassal os Ermenrich, according
to ‘ Biterolf’) and Randolf of Ancona (one of the Berner's men.
according to ‘ Dietrichs Flucht '); and Helmnod with Helmnot
(“ Helmnot von Tuscan‚' cf. ‘Alphart ’) who, in the ‘ Nibelungenlied '
and in ‘Alpharts Tod,' is a vassal of Dietrich. w. Miiller concludes
that they were Romans, or East Goths:

“Da nun beide durch ihre Herkunft nach Italien weisen, so darf
man in ihnen Romer oder Ostgothen sehen, mit welchen beiden Vol-
kern die 'Westgothen Kriege siihrten. Der ‘contus ferratus' deutet bei

Randolfauf die Ostgothen, der griechische name Eleuther (⁹ Ιιᾉὶευθεμυς)
bei Helmnod auf einen Angehorigen des romischen Reichs.94

W. Miiller‘s 95 attempt to make the last warrior Ewurlmrdus a Hun
is not so successful.
